# Data-Structures-Final-Project

Project Summary:
We are going to attempt to program a choose your own adventure game. It will combine all the major fandoms: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Pokemon, and Hunger Games. The user will be able to travel to the different fandom realms and make decisions to finish the quest. They'll be able to earn certain items to help them defeat the final boss. The user will traverse through a series of arrays, each containing a different world.  There will be a Charater class to customize the character as well as the functions that will make the journey possible.
